## Processing Experiments



### Planets

Planets is a really cool n-body physics simulation of Newtonian planets floating around in space. Originally written by me in C# .NET in the 8th grade, I've transposed the program to Java in Processing and cleaned it up a bit.

### Snake

I made a 

### Images

Brute force black and white image grid reverse search. You give it a pattern and it tries all possible images until it finds it. Obviously this would be expanded to actual-resolution grids, but it's 5x5 as a proof of concept. If you let it run for a minute it comes up with its result-- a smile.

### UI_Framework

This is a toy implementation of a framework for UI elements. Featuring buttons, text boxes, and more, it provides support for event handling using Runnable objects passed to control constructors.
 
### BouncyBalls

This is a tiny physics simulation, featuring a bunch of bouncy balls in a square window. It includes edge detection and bouncing, with a loose interpretation of Newtonian physics. Collisions between particles are kinda broken but it looks neat.
